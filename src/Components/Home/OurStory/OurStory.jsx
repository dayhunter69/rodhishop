            It all began in 2017 when we were working at a mobile shop in the
            Tamrakar complex NewRoad Kathmandu. We were in the sales department
            and we noticed a gap between customers and genuine mobile
            accessories products with reasonable prices. Customers were being
            sold low-quality products at high prices, with no after-sales
            services and no accurate information about the products. We knew
            that this was a real problem and we wanted to make a change.
